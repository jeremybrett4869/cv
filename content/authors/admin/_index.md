I am Shi Yingfei, a PhD student at the DISA program, focusing on bridging the gap between current Explainable AI techniques and clinical decision-making in cancer treatment. My research explores how AI can enhance the accuracy and usability of clinical decision support systems, aiming to make these technologies more interpretable and accessible to healthcare professionals.
