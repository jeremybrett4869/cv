    # summary: |
    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am Shi Yingfei, a PhD student at the DISA program, focusing on bridging the gap between current Explainable AI techniques and clinical decision-making in cancer treatment. My research explores how AI can enhance the accuracy and usability of clinical decision support systems, aiming to make these technologies more interpretable and accessible to healthcare professionals. I am passionate about developing solutions that improve patient care through innovative, data-driven approaches.
